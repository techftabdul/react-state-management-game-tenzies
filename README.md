# React State Management Project – Tenzies

Built a React project that demonstrates advanced state management using arrays of objects, conditional rendering, and child-to-parent communication via callbacks. This project strengthened my ability to think declaratively and manage interactive UI components.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

> React functional components & hooks (useState)

> Updating arrays of objects immutably

> Conditional styling & rendering

> Derived state logic without unnecessary side effects

> Passing functions as props for child → parent communication

Why It Matters for Clients:
While this is a small project, it shows the foundation of building interactive, dynamic web apps that solve real-world business needs — like enhancing client visibility, improving user engagement, or creating responsive dashboards.

Next Steps:
Ready to apply these React skills to build client-facing web applications and digital solutions that drive visibility, growth, and engagement.

What I Learned

This project was simple in concept but powerful for React practice. I strengthened my skills in:

Thinking declaratively rather than imperatively

Updating nested/array state immutably using .map()

Using callback props to communicate from child → parent

Conditional rendering and styling

Derived state computation (gameWon) without unnecessary useEffect

This foundation makes me confident to build real-world React applications next.
